### 1. sudo -

One of the most important commands in your arsenal. Short for 'super user do', enables permission access of the root user.

### 2. echo -

Another powerful command `'echo'` enables you to output or print to your terminal. This can be leveraged for debugging and you can pipe the output to other commands.

### 3. cat -

A multi-purpose command that was initially designed to concatenate files. I will typically use it as another method of printing to the terminal, an ssh key for example. It can also be leveraged to create new files, view file content, and redirect output as well. 

### 4. ps -

This is a straightforward command that provides a visual of the processes currently running on your machine. It can also be chained with other commands to provide further filtering.



### 5. service -

The `service` command is used to invoke system-wide services from the terminal. I will typically utilize this command when starting and stopping services such as MySQL and MongoDB.



### 6. kill -

This command is a powerful way to stop processes that are stuck due to system constraints. 



### 7. chmod -

The `chmod` command is among the most powerful linux tools used to change the access permissions of system files or objects.

### 8. chown - 

This command is very similar to the previous, the difference is it enables you to change ownership of files or directories.



### 9. alias -

A very commonly used command, this enables you to replace a word by a different string. Allowing for customization and alternate names for commands. 



### 10. ping -

The `ping` command is one of the most used tools in troubleshooting and diagnosing network connectivity issues. It enables you to test if IP is active or not. 



### 11. wget -

This is a handy command that enables you to download a file from the internet.



### 12. curl -

This is another powerful network tool that streamlines file transfers.



### 13. tail - 

The `tail` command enables you to view the bottom of the file. This can be very useful when mixed with cat and echo.



### 14. cal -

Another handy tool Unix provides is a little calendar right in your terminal.



### 15. touch - 

The `touch` command is very useful for creating empty files and for time stamping created files. 



### 16.  tar -

The tar command is used for packing up multiple files and directories in to a portable file. It is very popular for file compression and is highly efficient. 

### 17. locate - 

A handy command used to find the location of a specific file.



### 18. grep -

One of my personal favorites is the powerful `grep` command used when searching for patterns in large bodies of text. 



### 19. man - 

The man command stands for manual and is one of the most useful. It provides instructions for all commands in a straightforward display.



### 20. history - 

A handy command used to view previously entered commands.
